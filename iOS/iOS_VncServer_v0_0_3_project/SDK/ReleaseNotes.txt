=============================================================

Issues fixed in this release:
-----------------------------


Features not supported in this release:
---------------------------------------

* USB connections
* Multi-touch


Known issues in this release:
-----------------------------

MOB-9209:  Buttons (UIButton) sometimes render with lines across them (due to a
           bug in iOS).

MOB-10115: No skin buttons have any effect (due to limitations of public APIs
           provided by Apple).

MOB-15392: Remote selection of dialog box options is not possible using iOS 10.

MOB-16065: Multiple pointer or touch drag events that occur within
           approximately 0.5 seconds of each other may be misinterpreted by the
           SDK as a double click or double tap event. This may cause certain
           views to exhibit incorrect behaviour when remotely controlled.

MOB-16915: The SDK only captures the contents of the iOS application's key
           window when sending pixel data to the viewer. Applications which use
           multiple UIWindow instances may find that part of their user
           interface is not visible over a VNC connection.

MOB-16920: The SDK only supports remote pointer/touch input for views inside
           the iOS application's key window. Applications which use multiple
           UIWindow instances may find that part of their user interface cannot
           be controlled over a VNC connection.


Unsupported UI Elements:
------------------------

In addition to the above, some UI elements cannot be captured by the Server SDK
or have events injected into them:

* Status bar
* System UI dialogs (e.g. requests for location access)
* Videos (MPMoviePlayerController)
* Virtual keyboard
* Edit menu
