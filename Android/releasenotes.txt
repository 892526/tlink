Release Notes - VNC Automotive Server SDK 4.2 for Android
========================================================

Compatibility Break
-------------------

In the Network Advertiser, the MobileSolution URN has changed from
"urn:upnp-realvnc-com" to "urn:upnp-vncautomotive-com".

As a result of this change, old versions of the Network Discoverer (pre-4.2)
will no longer detect the Network Advertiser version 4.2 and above.

To detect a version 4.2+ Network Advertiser, the viewer must be running a
version 4.2+ Network Discoverer.


Issues fixed in this release:
-----------------------------

MOB-14595: The server may fail to perform VNC Automotive AES authentication, which will
           lead VNC Automotive connection to be disconnected at the VNC Automotive handshake stage.

MOB-16786: The server may stop responding occasionally due to the
           bug in network advertiser server.

           the VNC Automotive connection to be disconnected. 

MOB-16859: Server may crash when it receives text cut event from the viewer.

MOB-17717: The network advertiser SDK does not send SSDP alive message often
           enough.

MOB-17901: If an app is reinstalled the RCS does not show the authorisation
           dialog again.

           the beginning of VNC Automotive connection.

  context information listener with priority on its invocation sequence.

Note on USB tethering of Android phones
=======================================

VNC Automotive recommends that users follow these two rules when using USB
tethering to connect to the Android VNC Automotive server:

- Avoid enabling USB tethering and WiFi at the same time.

- After turning off tethering, reboot the phone before trying to use
  WiFi connectivity.

Not following these rules can lead to obscure and erratic networking
problems caused by Android using an inappropriate network address and
DHCP configuration on the WiFi interface. If using AAP then none of
these issues apply.

Some kernel versions available for the Nexus One android device
contain a bug where rapidly sending data over a tethered USB
connection can cause the device to freeze and restart a couple of
seconds later. This has been seen in kernel version 2.6.35.7, but may
affect other kernel versions. Other Android devices, such as the Nexus
S, are not affected. The VNC Automotive reference for this issue is MOB-6095.
