Note on USB tethering of Android phones
=======================================

VNC Automotive recommends that users follow these two rules when using USB
tethering to connect to the Android VNC server:

- Avoid enabling USB tethering and WiFi at the same time.

- After turning off tethering, reboot the phone before trying to use
  WiFi connectivity.

Not following these rules can lead to obscure and erratic networking
problems caused by Android using an inappropriate network address and
DHCP configuration on the WiFi interface. If using AAP then none of
these issues apply.

Some kernel versions available for the Nexus One android device
contain a bug where rapidly sending data over a tethered USB
connection can cause the device to freeze and restart a couple of
seconds later. This has been seen in kernel version 2.6.35.7, but may
affect other kernel versions. Other Android devices, such as the Nexus
S, are not affected. The RealVNC reference for this issue is MOB-6095.
